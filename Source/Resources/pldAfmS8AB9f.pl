# dumprsrc.pl -- dump a mac resource fork in a pseudo-readable form
#
# dumprsrc [-s] <file>
#
# <file> is a file containing the contents of a Mac resource fork.
# This is NOT the same as an AppleDouble, AppleSingle, or MacBinary
# file.  Programs like the ones at:
#
#   <ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/linux/sunsite/utils/compress/macutils.tar.gz>
#
# can produce this sort of file from that sort.  Or they could if the
# FTP server was still there (was it just down when I checked or is it
# really down?  Anyway the debian 'macutils' source package has all this
# stuff.
#
# Speaking of sorts, the '-s' option will cause the individual resources
# in the output dump to be ordered lexically (ascending) by resource
# type and numerically (also ascending) by resource ID within each type.
# Otherwise they will be output in the order they appear in the
# resource map (not the order the resource data physically appears in
# the file.
#
# dumprsrc doesn't work on pipes, sockets, named pipes or character
# devices since it seeks like a mother.

##### COPYRIGHT STATEMENT ###########################################
# This program may be considered part of the public domain.  That
# notwithstanding, it would be polite to give credit to James Deikun
# as the original author if you use it.
#

##### GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE FILE FORMAT ###########################
# The resource file format uses a lot of array structures that have
# a 'last' pointer (like $#foo) rather than a 'size'.  The 'last'
# pointer is unsigned and has no sentinel value so these arrays
# can't be empty.  That's OK since, given the rest of the format,
# if they'd be empty they just wouldn't be included at all.  It also
# uses a lot of offsets of various sizes relative to headers in the
# file, and the documentation can be a bit unclear--in one case I
# thought downright deceptive--about what exactly these offsets are
# relative to.  I've figured it out, though, and it's in the source
# if you're wondering.
#
# This format also uses a lot of 16-bit integers as offsets and
# sizes.  The limits this puts on the format aren't generally a
# problem in practice, although it does perhaps shed some light on
# why exactly That Company changed their stance and stopped the
# practice of putting all the program code in the resource fork.

##### GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE CODE ##################################
# As far as code goes, this really lives up to the name.  It follows
# the logical structure of the resource fork: file header -> map
# header -> type list -> resource reference lists -> resources.  It
# does this in a breadth-first manner.  It uses certain prefix and
# suffix conventions:
#
#  r*         - resource - useless, I know.
#  rdata*     - attributes of the resource data area
#  rmap*      - attributes of the resource map area
#  rtypelist* - attributes of the resource type list
#  rreflist*  - attributes of a resource reference list
#  rtl_*      - info from entries of the resource type list
#  rrl_*      - info from entries of a resource reference list
#  *start     - relative or absolute location of something in the file
#  *offset    - same thing (oops--make this meaningful in v2)
#  *len       - length, generally in bytes, of a structure in the file
#  *last      - index of last element in an array
#
# I apologize for the poor readability, especially given I'm posting
# this as example code.  It was originally designed for a more
# specific purpse.
#
# I also wish it had special handling for more resource types than
# 'STR#'...
#
# Now, let's get with the program, so to speak ...
